#SingleDS18B20

This is a small memory footprint library for a single DS18B20 temperature
sensor with an external power supply on a dedicated pin.

##Dependency

This library supports the DS18B20 only and needs the OneWire or the 
OneWireNoResistor library. If the OneWireNoResistor library is used the 4k7
pullup resistor can be omited for cable lengths shorter then 10 meters.

##Usage
See the examples how to deploy this library.
